Project Waifu Pastebin
-------------------------
Project Waifu (name not final) will be an online website where users will be able to download “assets” on Waifu’s, meaning, if the user has a waifusim client he can just choose a waifu from a list and the waifusim client will download pictures, sounds, animations, etc.
We will also create the waifusim client, but right now it's only a concept and details will follow after.
